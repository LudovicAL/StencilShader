# StencilShader
This "minigame" is made as an attempt to explore Unity's capabilities regarding the stencil buffer in the context of a Universal Render Pipeline project. It demonstrates renderer-slicing using two techniques:
1- Layer mask
2- Shader

An online version of the game can be accessed at https://ludovical.github.io/DisplacementShader/
(note that the page could take a few minutes to load the WebGL player in the background).
