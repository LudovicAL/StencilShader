# StencilShader
This project is made as an attempt to explore Unity's capabilities regarding the stencil buffer in the context of a Universal Render Pipeline project. It demonstrates renderer-slicing using two techniques:
1. Layer masks
2. Shaders

An online version of the "game" can be accessed at https://ludovical.github.io/StencilShader/
(note that the page could take a few minutes to load the WebGL player in the background).
